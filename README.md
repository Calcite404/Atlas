# Atlas
This is a atlas for personal tiny projects collections.
Since they would not be updated in the recent future (no need iteration), stroing relevent codes and data here.

> How does the COVID-19 epidemic affect the global economy? In order to explore this question, we chose the U.S. as
our sample case for analysis due to its abundance of data - our visualization results should also be applicable to other economies
or countries. Here we showed the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. economy in several aspects, including GDP growth, personal
income changes, and unemployment rate, which ranges from the third fiscal quarter (2019Q3) to present (2021Q1) for comparison.
Our visualization results also contain the changes in the case fatality rate (CFR) during the course of the epidemic, which can be used
as a comparative observation with the economy. The visualization mainly uses a choropleth graph as its backbone, a drop-down menu
and radio-items as the selection components, and a color bar to indicate the rate of change (percentage) for the different aspects. Our
target viewers are all people who are concerned about the epidemic situation and its economic impact, especially those who work on
the peopleâ€™s employment and livelihood.
